# KG STRENGTH SERVER SIDE CODE

This is an Cloud Native Application. It is not intended to be used by anyone else for anything but if you somehow ended up on this page you're welcome to have a look.

The one bit of code that you might find useful is the `mind-body-api.js` file which contains a simple interface written in NodeJS for MINDBODY. It's not fully flushed out but the basic work is there. I don't write much JavaScript code so I'm sure it's not well done but if want to take that code and give it a shot then have at it!

The file is copied to each directory as each dir represents a single Lambda function and needs that source in order to run. I could probably store it in S3 but... I don't feel like doing that so it's just in copy and pasted in each directory. 

Cheers ye strange wonderers of the web.
